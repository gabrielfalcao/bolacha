Bolacha

Bolacha is a simple http client that allows you testing http requests,
handling cookies and file upload.

Why "Bolacha" ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Bolacha" means "cookie" in Brazillian Portuguese.

Since one of the killer features of Bolacha is dealing with cookies
and session for you, I took very fair to name the project as "Bolacha".
