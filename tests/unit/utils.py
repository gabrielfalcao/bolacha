def assert_raises(exception, callable, *args, **kwargs):
    '''
    Discussion
       assert_raises() adds two optional arguments: "exc_args"
       and "exc_pattern". "exc_args" is a tuple that is expected
       to match the .args attribute of the raised exception.
       "exc_pattern" is a compiled regular expression that the
       stringified raised exception is expected to match.

    Original url: http://code.activestate.com/recipes/307970/
    Author: Trent Mick

    Usage: assert_raises(ExceptionType, method_to_execute,
                          arguments_to_method, kwargs_to_method,
                          exc_pattern=r'^.+$')
    Please note that exc_pattern is not required, but if passed
    matches the exception message.

    Fail Conditions
    Fails on exception not raised, wrong exception type or
    invalid exception message.
